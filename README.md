### What I learned

Marking this as my first time using React and Tailwind CSS, this served as a great introduction in creating a webpage using these frameworks and further build my knowledge in future challenges


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - This was very useful as an introduction to a different way in using CSS. This way was quite fun to use and I will use try to use this as a main framework in the future
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) - This helped me in installing the react framework for the first time in visual studio code
